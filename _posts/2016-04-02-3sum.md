Question
--------

> Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that
  a + b + c = 0?
  Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

> Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

>     For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

>     A solution set is:
>     [
>       [-1, 0, 1],
>       [-1, -1, 2]
>     ]

Solution
--------

```cpp
```
